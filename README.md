# GameEngine

### WORK IN PROGRESS
#### This application was made by following https://vulkan-tutorial.com/, displaying the viking room. Instead of copy and pasting each of the lines of code into the editor, I made sure to read and understand what each of the lines of code did, and typed themn out myself.

#### I am continuing to add to this project, attempting to incorporate raytracing by following this guide: https://nvpro-samples.github.io/vk_raytracing_tutorial_KHR/, but without utilization of the nvvk raytracing libraries. This has proved to be quite the challenge, but has improved my fluency in c++ quite a bit.
